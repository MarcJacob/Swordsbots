Gameplay video, beating the Miniboss & First Boss : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F38thqCua7o

Learning project made in a little over a month, following a sort of mixed concept taking elements from "Room based permadeath adventure" genre games like Isaac or Returnal, and skill based melee fighting games such as Dark Souls and Mount & Blade.

Currently features a single level with a very basic Room system (contents of the rooms will be random between a few possible layouts), one miniboss and the first boss.

Instructions (didn't get around to making an in game tutorial yet) :

WASD (ZQSD for French keyboards) - Move around
Mouse panning - Looking around, face direction when in *Guard Stance*
Hold Right Mouse Button - *Guard Stance*, allows active blocking of hits, rolls, parry dashes...
Space (*Out of Guard Stance*) - Jump
Shift - Sprint

*In Guard Stance*

Mouse Panning - Looking around, facing that direction AND determines which direction to block & attack (any of the 4 diagonal directions)
Left Click - Attack with current *Guard Direction*
Shift + Spacebar - Roll in movement direction
Spacebar - Parry dash. When well timed and blocking in the correct direction will *Parry* instead of *Block*. A bug currently makes this useless as enemies will not be any more penalized being parried than when being blocked.

## Currently it is recommended you mostly use rolls and blocking. Be aware that the game is really difficult especially if you have never played Mount & Blade and / or Dark Souls. The plan is to eventually start from scratch and build a much better set of learning challenges and in game guides for new players.

The game has no further content after the first boss ("Firewall"). If you do beat it simply leave the game using alt+f4.

Making this took me to nearly ever corner of the engine, hence why the gameplay itself was not a major focus - most of my time was spent on research and testing, with a lot of it not yielding much fruit for this particular project.
