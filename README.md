Learning project made in a little over a month, following a sort of mixed concept taking elements from "Room based permadeath adventure" genre games like Isaac or Returnal, and skill based melee fighting games such as Dark Souls and Mount & Blade.

Currently features a single level with a very basic Room system (contents of the rooms will be random between a few possible layouts), one miniboss and the first boss.
